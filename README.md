This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Covid-19-timeline
-------------------------

## This is
An application that shows how new coronavirus spread across the world over time.

Try it out on my [github page](https://yuanboxue-amber.github.io/covid-19-timeline/)

![Demo](/demo.gif)

## I used
- typescript
- react
- d3

## I get my data from
- Topojson to create the map: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/world-atlas@2/countries-110m.json
- Covid-19 total cases per country: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/total_cases.csv

## What I want to do next
- Click and pin the map to center
- Filter and highlight countries by dragging a selection bar on color legend

## I did this because
- I'm following [Curran Kelleher's awesome D3 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8V5o2UHG0E), and wanting to get some practice.
