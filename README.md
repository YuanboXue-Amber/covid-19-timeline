This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Covid-19-timeline
An application that shows how new coronavirus spread across the world over time.

Try it out on my [github page](https://yuanboxue-amber.github.io/covid-19-timeline/)

## I used
- typescript
- react
- d3

## I get my data from
- Topojson to create the map: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/world-atlas@2/countries-50m.json
- Covid-19 total cases per country: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total_cases.csv

## What I want to do next
- Click and pin the map to center
- Add a new tab for different map, for example
    - map about total death
    - a different type of map instead of choropleth map
    - bar chart showing death rate per country

## I did this because
- I'm following [Curran Kelleher's awesome D3 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8V5o2UHG0E), and wanting to get some practice.
